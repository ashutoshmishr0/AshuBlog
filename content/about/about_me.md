<!-- Hello, I'm **Atul Raj**. Computer science student from India 🇮🇳. 
Figuring out my way in this huge world of knowledge. Born in **1999**. From a small hilly village of Uttarkhand.

In 2015, I got my PC and Internet connection. Since then my curiosity is being feed through it. Besides computers I have few hobbies too.


I like to cook, gardening, well not the flower one but the kitchen one. Isn't it good, that you get to eat things you've sown.

Like to play music, through an amplifier. Seriously though, can play few notes in Flute.

Haven't travelled much so this is not a hobby but a dream.

> I want to buy a **Bike** 🚲 and explore my own state, country, maybe the world too. (Will keep you on the loop if I get one).

Well, listen up! The first rule of fight club is.. Yeah you got the idea. I do watch movies, documentaries (Sir [David Attenborough](https://vegas-suites.com/attenboroughfilm/)) and [Man VS Wild!](https://go.discovery.com/tv-shows/man-vs-wild)


## About some technicalities

### I'm very interested in:

* Privacy and Security 🔐 [Snowden!](https://edwardsnowden.substack.com/)
* Open Source technologies
* GNU/LINUX
* [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/)
* Computer Networking
* Fixing basic electrical things
* Embedded systems (Arduino, RasPi, Adafruit)
* Decentralised technologies
* WEB3


I guess that's it. Here was a little about me. Thank you for visiting the site, hope I'll see you frequently!

Have a nice day! Reader 😊 -->
